# Balens Build System

Balens is a simple, one-click build system designed to streamline the compilation process for C++ projects. With Balens, you can configure your project settings in a single configuration file and build your project with a single command.
## Features

    One-Click Build: Simply run ./balens to compile your project.

    Customizable Configuration: Define your project settings in a single configuration file.

    Easy Installation: Optionally install the compiled output with a single flag.

    Resource Management: Include resource files directly in your build process.

## Configuration File

The configuration file (config.ini) for Balens allows you to define various settings for your project. Below is an example configuration:

``` ini
PROJECT_NAME=[Balens Build System]
BUILD_DIR=cache
SRC_DIR=src
INCLUDE_DIR=include
COMPILER=g++
FLAGS= -lstdc++fs -std=c++17 -lstdc++
OUTPUT=balens
INSTALLATION=T
USE_BLSRC=false
RESOURCE_FILE=BLSRC
```

## Configuration Options

    PROJECT_NAME: The name of your project.

    BUILD_DIR: The directory where build artifacts will be stored.

    SRC_DIR: The directory containing your source files.

    INCLUDE_DIR: The directory containing your header files.

    COMPILER: The compiler to use (e.g., g++).

    FLAGS: Additional compiler flags.

    OUTPUT: The name of the output executable.

    INSTALLATION: Whether to install the compiled output (T for true, F for false).

    USE_BLSRC: Whether to use the BLSRC resource file (true or false).

    RESOURCE_FILE: The name of the resource file to include in the build.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites

    g++: Ensure that g++ is installed on your system.

    C++17: The project is configured to use C++17 standard.

## Building the Project

    Clone the Repository:

```
    Configure the Project:
    Edit the BalensSystem.balens file to match your project settings.

    Build the Project:
    Simply run the following command:

``` bash
